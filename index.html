                <p class="">
                    The first camera I bought when I was a sophomore, that was a Sony point shoot camera. I mostly
                    used
                    to take photos of my friends, kids and nature at that time in Bangladesh. The first DSLR camera
                    was
                    my Canon 500D 18-55mm f 3.5-5.6 lens, which was a gift from my mom as a first anniversary gift
                    on
                    2011.
                    But I slowly started learning about photography right after my first child was born on 2014.
                    Currently
                    I am playing with Canon 6D, 50 mm f 1.4 lens, and I love it.</p>

                The book that I admired most about photography is “How to photograph almost everything” by Tom
                Ang.
                This is a very good book where almost everything about photography is described very precisely
                and
                clearly. However, I love the work of Steve McCurry, and Art Wolfe. I take Dave’s class on
                photography,
                it’s a room full of a wonderful teacher, and so many beautiful people! Currently I am a stay at
                home mom,
                so I took the photography class to give myself a room to keep something that I love. Dave’s
                class
                has just opened my door.



                I find the most alluring thing about photography is the art of capturing a simple object
                extraordinarily. To me the most challenging part about photography is finding the correct light
                and
                perspective in a photo. The other challenge I feel when I take photos of kids, since they
                aren’t
                always willing to take photos. But I always like to capture them as they are. I love all their
                actions. I
                love to take photos of kids.
